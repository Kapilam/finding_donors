# Project Title: Finding Donors for CharityML #

## 1. Introduction ##

CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. There are nearly 15 million working Californians.

## 2. Objectives ##

1. Data exploration
2. Data preprocessing and feature engineering
3. Identify potential supervised learning algorithms to accurately model individuals income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census
4. Identify suitable evaluation metric
5. Choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results
6. Optimise the selected algorithms to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail
7. Rank importance of features according to the chosen classifier
8. Identify top 5 features for the selected ML model
9. Compare the Optimized ML model with only top 5 features 

## 3. Data Set ##

The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income) (Ron Kohavi, 1996)
